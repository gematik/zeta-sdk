# RELEASE NOTES

## Version: v1.3.2

This version implements the ZETA protocol for the ZETA client SDK.

It provides SDK bindings for kotlin (as original implementation), Java, C++, and C#

### Included Features:

#### General Protocol:

The implementation covers two main use cases, with a large overlap. The general functions are:

- Discovery of server parameters via .well-known files
- Software-based Client Attestation
- DPoP token generation
- Client Registration
- Access Token handling
- ASL protocol implementation (messages 1-4 as well as payload encryption/decryption)
- Web Sockets

Specifically for practitioner-side implementations ("Stufe 1"), the following features are implemented:

- SM(C)-B Token generation and use
- Support for stationary clients (see below)

For insurant-side implementations ("Stufe 2"), the following features are implemented as preview:

- Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) using e-Mail OTP identity verification
- OIDC-based login using a SekIDP
- Support for mobile clients (see below)

#### Clients:

This section has the available client implementations, all based on the SDK:

- kotlin multiplatform based SDK implementation

The other clients use this SDK and show how to integrate the SDK into the various, supported
runtime environments.

##### Test clients
- testdriver client as container image to use as a proxy for a resource server in test setups, using the JDK-based runtime.
- nativedriver client as container image to use as a proxy for a resource server in test setups, using the native build runtime.
- kotlin-based demo client to manually test against the test Fachdienst (resource server)

##### Stationary clients:
- Java-client example for how to integrate and use the SDK in a Java application
- C++ client build
- C# client build

##### Mobile clients:
- Demo client app for Android
- Demo client app for iOS

### Known issues:

- TLS validation is not fully implemented on iOS
- The SDK does not fully handle paths parts in the AS well-known URL. The AS well-known is defined
  as on the root path, so this is WONTFIX.


## Changes in 1.3.2 (from 1.3.0)

### New Features

- Updated Gradle dependencies to the latest compatible versions.
- Refactored time handling across the SDK by introducing the ZetaClock interface,
 allowing a custom clock implementation to be injected.

### Behavioural Changes

- N/A

### Bug Fixes

- Added support for extracting stapled OCSP responses on Android API levels below 37.
- ANFTI2-915 / ANFTI2-781: Updated ktor-client-fork with upstream changes to resolve reported WebSocket issues.
- ANFTI2-889: Updated the RevocationChecker HTTP client to use the configured SDK HTTP settings, including proxy and timeout configuration.
- Fixed OCSP stapled-response handling to comply with A_27379-01.

## Changes in 1.3.0 (from 1.2.5)

### New Features

Please note that mobile device features ("Stufe 2") are preview only.

- Support for mobile clients (using software attestation)
- iOS Mobile demo app (preview)
- Android Mobile demo app (preview)
- SDK API extended to include DCR and OIDC callbacks for gathering user e-Mail and One-Time-Password (OTP).

  Also now has buttons for explicit discovery, registration, and authentication

### Behavioral Changes

- Adaption of the validation of the TLS certificate chain to achieve compatibility
  with the gematik PKI CA infrastructure. This mainly affects the ASL functionality.

### Bug Fixes

- Caching for TLS/ASL revocation and trust data (OCSP, CRL, ASL certificates)
- ASL error handling (parsing json vs. cbor)

- EC curve validation: TLS handshake now enforces allowed EC curves at the OpenSSL level
- Proxy password: not sent as a pointer representation, instead of the actual string value

### Improvements
- Logging now uses a unified implementation across all platforms. SLF4J dependency removed from JVM. Default output now uses `println`
